_Degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified
period of time._

<dl>
    <dt>Maturity</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system, product or component meets needs for reliability under normal operation.</dd>
    
    <dt>Availability</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system, product or component is operational and accessible when required for use.</dd>
    
    <dt>Fault tolerance</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system, product or component operates as intended despite the presence of hardware or software
    faults.</dd>
    
    <dt>Recoverability</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which, in the event of an interruption or a failure, a product or system can recover the data
    directly affected and re-establish the desired state of the system.</dd>
</dl>

## Metrics

Everything you do to improve Reliability is, in the end, serving one externally measurable quality: availability.
Measuring availability is commonly done with Uptime.

<dl>
    <dt>★ Uptime</dt>
    <dd>The relative time the system is available in a specific time period.</dd>
    
    <dt>Mean time between failures (MTBF)</dt>
    <dd>The average time that elapses between two consecutive failures.</dd>
    
    <dt>Mean time to failure (MTTF)</dt>
    <dd>The average time a (part of a) system lasts until it fails. This is a metric for unrepairable systems.</dd>
    
    <dt>Mean time to recovery/repair (MTTR)</dt>
    <dd>The average time it takes to recover from a failure.</dd>
</dl>
