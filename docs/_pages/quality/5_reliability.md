_Degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified
period of time._

## What is it?

A reliable system is a system that is robust enough to deal with hardware and software faults, and that is recoverable
from faults.

The following are more detailed quality attributes related to Reliability.

<dl>
    <dt>Maturity</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system, product or component meets needs for reliability under normal operation.</dd>
    
    <dt>Availability</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system, product or component is operational and accessible when required for use.</dd>
    
    <dt>Fault tolerance</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system, product or component operates as intended despite the presence of hardware or software
    faults.</dd>
    
    <dt>Recoverability</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which, in the event of an interruption or a failure, a product or system can recover the data
    directly affected and re-establish the desired state of the system.</dd>
</dl>

## How to measure it

Everything you do to improve Reliability is, in the end, serving one externally measurable quality: availability.
Measuring availability is commonly done with Uptime.

<dl>
    <dt>Uptime</dt>
    <dd>The relative time the system is available in a specific time period. For example: 99.9%</dd>
</dl>
