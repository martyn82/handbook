_This characteristic represents the performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions._

<dl>
    <dt>Time behaviour</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing 
    its functions, meet requirements.</dd>
    
    <dt>Resource utilisation</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which the amounts and types of resources used by a product or system, when performing its functions,
    meet requirements.</dd>
    
    <dt>Capacity</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which the maximum limits of a product or system parameter meet requirements.</dd>
</dl>

## Metrics

In the end, the one externally visible metric that will tell you how well Performance Efficiency is doing in your system,
is measuring the responsiveness.

<dl>
    <dt>Response time</dt>
    <dd>The average amount of time it takes for the system to provide a response in a given time period.
    Example: 25ms</dd>
    
    <dt>ApDex</dt>
    <dd>The weighted average of responses that were 'satisfactory', 'tolerating', and 'frustrating'.
    Example: 0.9</dd>
</dl>
