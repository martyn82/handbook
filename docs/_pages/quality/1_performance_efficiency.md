_This characteristic represents the performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions._

<dl>
    <dt>Time behaviour</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing 
    its functions, meet requirements.</dd>
    
    <dt>Resource utilisation</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which the amounts and types of resources used by a product or system, when performing its functions,
    meet requirements.</dd>
    
    <dt>Capacity</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which the maximum limits of a product or system parameter meet requirements.</dd>
</dl>

## Metrics

In the end, doing well in Performance Efficiency is serving the responsiveness (time behaviour) of the system.
Therefore, the following are KPIs for Performance Efficiency.

<dl>
    <dt>★ ApDex</dt>
    <dd>The weighted average of responses that were 'satisfactory', 'tolerating', and 'frustrating'.</dd>

    <dt>★ Response time</dt>
    <dd>The average amount of time it takes for the system to provide a response in a given time period.</dd>
    
    <dt>Load</dt>
    <dd>The load imposed on a system. Usually measured as three averages: last 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes.</dd>
    
    <dt>CPU usage</dt>
    <dd>The relative CPU utilisation in a time period.</dd>
    
    <dt>Memory usage</dt>
    <dd>The relative memory usage.</dd>
    
    <dt>Disk usage</dt>
    <dd>The relative disk usage.</dd>
    
    <dt>Disk IOPs</dt>
    <dd>Disk read/write performance. Measured in operations per second.</dd>
    
    <dt>Network IOPs</dt>
    <dd>Network throughput (sent/received) measured in operations per second.</dd>
    
    <dt>Throughput</dt>
    <dd>Throughput measured in requests per time unit.</dd>
</dl>
