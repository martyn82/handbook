_This characteristic represents the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be
modified to improve it, correct it or adapt it to changes in environment, and in requirements._

<dl>
    <dt>Modularity</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one
    component has minimal impact on other components.</dd>
    
    <dt>Reusability</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which an asset can be used in more than one system, or in building other assets.</dd>
    
    <dt>Analysability</dt>
    <dd>Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of
    an intended change to one or more of its parts, or to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or
    to identify parts to be modified.</dd>
    
    <dt>Modifiability</dt>
    <dd>Degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or
    degrading existing product quality.</dd>
    
    <dt>Testability</dt>
    <dd>Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be established for a system, product or
    component and tests can be performed to determine whether those criteria have been met.</dd>
</dl>

## Metrics

<dl>
    <dt>Coupling</dt>
    <dd>Efferent/afferent coupling for classes or components.</dd>

    <dt>Cyclomatic Complexity</dt>
    <dd>The number of lineary independent paths; usually measured per unit/function.</dd>

    <dt>Relative Duplication</dt>
    <dd>The relative amount of duplicated code, measured in duplicative blocks.</dd>
    
    <dt>Test Coverage</dt>
    <dd>The relative amount of code covered by (automated) tests.</dd>
    
    <dt>Unit size</dt>
    <dd>The average amount of lines of code (LoC) per unit/function.</dd>
    
    <dt>Volume</dt>
    <dd>The total amount of lines of code (LoC) of the program (i.e., library or deployable unit).</dd>
</dl>
