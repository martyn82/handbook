    <dt>Rationale</dt>
    <dd>
        This metric refers to the time it takes to deploy a change to production.
        <br><br>
        As the rationale of the <a href="{{ '/metrics/deployment-frequency/' | relative_url }}">Deployment Frequency</a> metric is that high performing teams release more often. This metric tells something about the time it
        takes to deploy a change to production. Shorter lead times make room for more changes to be deployed in a given time period.
