_The number of open known security vulnerabilities categorised by severity level gives an overview of the state of security in the system._

<dl>
    <dt>Key Performance Indicator</dt>
    <dd>Yes (Security)</dd>
    
    <dt>Aggregable</dt>
    <dd>Yes<br>
        <small>Can be measured in a single component and across components in a system.</small>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Rationale</dt>
    <dd>Keeping track of severity categorised open security vulnerabilities gives a insight in the state of vulnerability of a system.
        The categorisation is typically: Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational.
        <br><br>Important is that this list is recent. Usually the only way to get a recent overview is to conduct manual security tests.
        Penetration tests, web application security testing, and ethical hacking are proven ways of getting this overview.

    <dt>Improving</dt>
    <dd>Improving on this metric means fixing the open security issues. Additionally, security tactics should be applied:
